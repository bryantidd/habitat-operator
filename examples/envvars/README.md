# Configuration via environment variables

This example demonstrates how environment variables can be used for service configuration.

## Workflow

After the Habitat operator is up and running, execute the following command from the root of this repository:

    kubectl create -f examples/config/habitat.yml

By default, Redis listens on port 6379, but we change this to 6999 by passing
the `HAB_REDIS` environment variable to the supervisor.

When you inspect the logs of the pod that was just created (with `kubectl logs
$podname`) you should see something like:

    redis.foobar(O): 42:M 07 Feb 15:34:08.765 * The server is now ready to accept connections on port 6999

## Environment Variables

You can use the full range of options defined by the Downward API. For an
overview, please refer to [this
